## ðŸ“Œ What is this?
A really good question. Honestly, it changes as I'm making it. My overall intention is for the program to:
1. Download necessary data from PokeAPI
2. Build a program structured off the data
3. Create some kind of game using the above^
Ultimately, this project is a learning tool for me, at least for now.
